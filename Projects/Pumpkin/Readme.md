I made my daughter a bunch of pumpkins to paint and decorate with for Halloween, and I wanted to share the flat Pumpkin file with you!  

There are two files in this folder:
* Illustrator file: use this to edit and change the original file (like adding fun faces!)
* PDF file: drop this one into your Dremel laser cutting software to use. Select "Import Cut Lines" when you drop it in, and you're ready to cut!

That means you may make changes, but you must share your file like I have, and you cannot use this file for commercial purposes (to make money).
